      question: 'What makes Flotilla different from GitHub/GitLab?',
      answer: 'We implement real distributed consensus with the Raft algorithm, not just replication. When a node fails, the cluster automatically elects a new leader in ~150ms with zero downtime. This is production-grade distributed systems, not just Git hosting.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is this production-ready?',
      answer: 'Yes. We have 80%+ test coverage, comprehensive E2E tests with Playwright, complete documentation, and rigorous engineering practices (SOLID, DRY, KISS). Every commit follows the same high standards. This is not a weekend project.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What tech stack do you use?',
      answer: 'Full-stack TypeScript: Next.js 15 + React 19 frontend, NestJS 11 + Prisma 6 backend. PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO infrastructure. Monorepo with pnpm workspace. Everything is type-safe, tested, and documented.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I self-host?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. MIT License means you can fork, modify, build, sellâ€”whatever you want. Docker Compose setup takes 10 minutes. No vendor lock-in. Complete control over your infrastructure.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does Raft consensus work?',
      answer: 'Raft divides consensus into three sub-problems: Leader Election (choose one server to act as cluster leader), Log Replication (leader accepts log entries and replicates them), and Safety (ensure consistency). Our implementation uses WebSocket for real-time communication and persistent storage for log entries.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What about internationalization (i18n)?',
      answer: 'Full zh/en support built-in from day one, not as an afterthought. 100% UI coverage, zero hard-coded strings. Language preferences auto-persist. This is proper i18n architecture, not a plugin.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I contribute?',
      answer: 'Read our Contributing Guide in the docs. We follow strict engineering standards: comprehensive tests, complete documentation, SOLID principles. Pull requests must pass all tests and include docs. We review thoroughly because quality matters.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the performance like?',
      answer: '150ms automatic failover. 60fps animations with Framer Motion. Turbopack hot reload under 2s. PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. Redis caching. MinIO object storage. We optimize ruthlessly because your time matters.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a hosted version?',
      answer: 'Not yet. This is an academic/open-source project demonstrating production-grade distributed consensus. Self-hosting via Docker Compose is the recommended approach. We may offer hosted version in the future.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What license is this under?',
      answer: 'MIT License. One of the most permissive licenses. Fork it, modify it, build on it, sell it. No bait-and-switch open core model. Every feature is truly open source.',
    },
