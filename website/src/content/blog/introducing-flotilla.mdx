# Introducing Flotilla

We're excited to announce **Flotilla**, a production-ready distributed code hosting platform built with the Raft consensus algorithm at its core.

## Why We Built Flotilla

Modern software development relies heavily on distributed collaboration, but most code hosting platforms treat distribution as a technical afterthought. We believe that **distributed teams should be as reliable as distributed systems**.

### The Problem

Traditional code hosting platforms face several challenges:

- **Single Point of Failure**: Centralized architecture means downtime affects everyone
- **Trust Without Verification**: Consensus is assumed, not algorithmically guaranteed
- **Scaling Bottlenecks**: Vertical scaling limits growth potential
- **Opaque Internals**: Black-box systems that don't expose their coordination mechanisms

### Our Solution: Raft Consensus

Flotilla implements a simplified Raft consensus algorithm to ensure:

```typescript
interface RaftNode {
  nodeId: string
  state: 'follower' | 'candidate' | 'leader'
  currentTerm: number
  votedFor: string | null
  log: LogEntry[]
  commitIndex: number
  lastApplied: number
}
```

**Key Features:**

- **150ms Automatic Failover**: When a leader node fails, the cluster elects a new leader in under 150 milliseconds
- **Strong Consistency**: All nodes agree on the state of the repository through log replication
- **Fault Tolerance**: The system remains operational as long as a majority of nodes are healthy
- **Transparent Coordination**: You can visualize the consensus process in real-time

## What Makes Flotilla Different?

### 1. Academic Rigor Meets Production Reality

Flotilla isn't just a side project‚Äîit's a carefully architected system following structured software engineering lifecycle:

- Requirements Analysis
- Architecture Design
- Test-Driven Development
- Comprehensive Documentation

### 2. Full-Stack TypeScript

Both backend (NestJS 11) and frontend (Next.js 15) are written in TypeScript 5.7, ensuring end-to-end type safety.

### 3. Enterprise-Grade Features

- **Organization & Team Management**: Hierarchical RBAC with OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER roles
- **Issue Tracking System**: Complete issue management with labels, milestones, and markdown support
- **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket-based live updates
- **S3-Compatible Storage**: MinIO integration for distributed file storage

### 4. Self-Hosted & Open Source

Flotilla is MIT-licensed and designed for self-hosting:

```bash
# Clone and run in under 5 minutes
git clone https://github.com/CPU-JIA/Cloud-Dev-Platform.git
cd Cloud-Dev-Platform
docker-compose up -d
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## The Road Ahead

We have an ambitious 24-month roadmap planned for 2025-2027:

**Phase 1 (Q4 2024 - Q2 2025): Foundation**
