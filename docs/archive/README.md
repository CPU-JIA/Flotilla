## 📝 Archive Purpose

### Historical Documents (Root Level)
These documents were created during the initial development phase and have been superseded by more comprehensive documentation:

- **PROJECT_SUMMARY_2025-10-20.md**: Early project overview (replaced by README.md and CLAUDE.md)
- **Raft实现完成报告_2025-10-20.md**: Raft implementation completion report (implementation details now in 分布式共识算法设计方案.md)
- **项目任务总述_2025-10-21.md**: Early task summary
- **项目综合学术报告_2025-10-20.md**: Academic report from initial development phase

### Temporary Design Documents

#### Phase 2 (Code Search)
Design documents created during the Code Search feature development (completed 2025-10-27):
- Architecture design and implementation planning
- These were working documents during development, now replaced by implementation

#### Phase 3 (Pull Request System)
Design documents created during the PR workflow development (completed 2025-10-28):
- PR enhancement design, implementation plan, and UI specifications
- These were working documents during development, now replaced by implementation

## 🔍 Why Archive?

These documents are archived rather than deleted for the following reasons:

1. **Historical Reference**: Provide insight into the project's evolution and decision-making process
2. **Design Rationale**: Document design choices and trade-offs made during development
3. **Learning Resource**: Serve as reference for understanding why certain approaches were chosen
4. **Academic Record**: Maintain a complete record of the development process for academic purposes
